**Struggles:** 

JS is kicking my behind. The switch operator lesson in the cert made no sense. I had to check the hint and see others struggling and saying the same thing. So I felt a lil better. But I am shaken. 2 days in a row. I'm going to make a post about it.

<br>


**Links:** 
- [Technical Documentation Page for fCC RWD Cert](https://codepen.io/sadiejay/pen/QWqoNoz) - got the skeleton done. Gonna laid down the CSS this week. Looking forward to using `overscroll-behavior`.

- Complete one RWD project for fCC
- Check out the #100daysofcode tag on dev.to
-Play around with my open source issue

<br>


**Struggles:** 

Time management is now a concern. I worked on the fCC JS course all day. I'm not feeling too well so I wasn't on top of my time management game.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

This is a roller coaster. I'm struggling with objects again lol I'm gonna give less time to the fCC course tomorrow and dive into my open source issue.exercism

- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/) - Checked out this site for more js practice!

- Work on the JS Cert with fCC (but not all day!)
- Make progress on one RWD project for fCC
- Check out the #100daysofcode tag on dev.to

<br>


**Struggles:** 
My open source issue is down on gitlab and I'm not sure if I should say something? I think I'll check again tomorrow and if it's still not working I'll reach out. I'll work on a RWD project for now.


<br>

**Thoughts:**
I took it easy today. After yesterday I could use a break from going so hard in the code. I at least figured out what the issue was in the lesson I struggled with all day, and had help from the community. That felt good.

- Comment on my open source issue
- Change og info portfolio site to show different fav icon/sm photo
- Figure out how to get commits into my contribution graph
- Draft up a couple of DEV.to articles
    - my favorite keyboard shortcuts
    - my hacktoberfest experience

<br>


**Struggles:** 
Understanding when to say "Hey something's wrong" on my open source issue. I didn't want to add fuel to the fire, but I also don't want to withhold info. 

<br>

**Thoughts:**
I'm realizing that my experience contributing to open source projects was really valuable. I'm gonna talk that up.

<br>

### Day 9: 20 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

- Commented on my open source issue
- Updated my portfolio

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- Test on my open source issue
- Figure out how to get commits into my contribution graph
- Work on JS cert


<br>


**Struggles:** 

Now I'm stuggling to manage timing a "hey I need some help," response haha. I'm trying to make a footer stick to the bottom of a page. My solution works when the height is signifigantly taller than the width. However, when the width is wider than the height (ex. mobile screens in landscape mode) the footer blocks content on the screen. I think, I'm almost positive there's a way to write a media query that'll style accordingly, but that's over my head at the moment. It's all part of the learning experience tho.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

I've made it to loops in my JS cert and I'm playing around with `push` / `unshift`. I can make an array list even and odd numbers backwards using a simple loop, with either method, and it makes me happy.

<br>


### Day 10: 21 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

- Test on my open source issue
- Figure out how to get commits into my contribution graph
- Work on JS cert

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- Talk to someone in my network about their role and job applying experience.



<br>


**Struggles:** 
I'm feeling a little bad that I'm not going to be able to do as much on the weekends but I'm also ok about that too. I need to manage how much time I do this and have a life.


<br>

**Thoughts:**
I was really happy to have had talked with a dev in my network. I'm really inspired to start the job hunt and I feel less presure to "know everything".
<br>
<br>
<br>


### Day 11: 22 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

- Reached out to dev in my network
- Work on JS cert

<br>


**Today's plans:**

Make one change and relax


<br>


**Struggles:** 
Not really struggling right now. I'm happy to have made my lil change and keep today about life outside of the computer


<br>

**Thoughts:**
Enjoy the weekend!
Hope the fork detaches soon!

<br>


### Day 12: 23 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

Updated description on portfolio

<br>


**Today's plans:**

Make one change and relax


<br>


**Struggles:** 



<br>

**Thoughts:**

<br>

**Links:** 
- [Technical Documentation Page for fCC RWD Cert](https://codepen.io/sadiejay/pen/QWqoNoz) - Added `id`s per test requirements. It was uncomfortable adding special characters in the names of the `id`s. I honestly thought you couldn't so I learned something there!
<br>
<br>
<br>


### Day 13: 24 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

Edited fCC project

<br>


**Today's plans:**
Make one change and relax


<br>


**Struggles:** 

Again it felt super weird to add special charaters to `href`s.


<br>

**Thoughts:**

Gonna get back into JS now that I've made some progress in my fCC project.

### Day 14: 25 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

Edited fCC project

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- Work on JS Cert
- Update resume


<br>


**Struggles:** 

I'm struggling to understand how to use the length of an array in a recursive function. The profile lookup task has me stumped.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

My pomodoro clock of choice now doesn't work. I'm struggling to find an app that'll work in the background and allow me to change up the focus/break state. I wanna do it with JS but also make my own app if I have to.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Day 15: 26 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

Work on JS Cert
Update resume

<br>


**Today's plans:**

Update my github readme


<br>


**Struggles:** 

Not much today. I think I need a lil bit of a challenge to make up for the slack of the past week-ish.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

I like doing the fCC JS activities, but I don't like that there's no interface or a way to save my code. I think I'm gonna try and build something around one of the tasks. Especially on that uses JSON data. I'm gonna take a look at [frontend mentor](frontendmentor.io) to see if I can get some design ideas/inspo.

### Day 16: 27 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**


Updated github profile readme

<br>


**Today's plans:**

Work on RWD Cert projects


<br>


**Struggles:** 

I don't want to lose steam on my RWD project, but I also don't want to get too into the weeds with styling. Especially when it's not required.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

I finished a RWD project!!! WHOO!! 1 down, 4 more to go. It's not my best design work (no design) and I need to clean up the code, but it's passing. I can breathe.

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- One change and relax
- JS Cert (maybe?)


<br>


**Struggles:** 



<br>

**Thoughts:**

I'm going ahead and starting the tribute page. I can always go back and add the styling to these projects.

### Day 19: 30 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**


- Work on RWD Cert projects

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- JS cert
- Code Assessment for job application
- Prep job materials


<br>


**Struggles:** 

Not being able to figure out the code assesment was a lil bit of a blow to my confidence.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

I'm still glad for the expereince. It was the best code assessment I've encountered. I can actually understand how data structures fit in the real world. I'm a lil more interested in learning how to extract info from JSON. The JS cert was a step in the right direction for that.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Day 20: 31 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

- Code Assessment for job application
- Prep job materials

<br>


**Today's plans:**

RWD project - tribute page


<br>


**Struggles:** 

Darn it. I missed pushing to github yesterday. And I did a ton of coding yesterday in fCC!!

<br>

**Thoughts:**

Next time I notice I didn't commit for the day, I'm just gonna stop and do something. Lesson learned.

### Day 21: 1 Feb 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

RWD project - tribute page

<br>


**Today's plans:**

RWD project - tribute page
JS cert


<br>


**Struggles:** 



<br>

**Thoughts:**

Just plugging along with JS and the tribute page. I don't like building without a design so this is a challenge for me. I"m going to mimic the fCC design and just leave it at that. I'm missing the [frontend mentor](frontendmentor.io) projects now. On the brightside.  Ithink with what I've learned in th JS course I can build out some of the logic to some basic game or calculator.

### Day 22: 2 Feb 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

RWD project - tribute page

<br>


**Today's plans:**


RWD project - product landing page



<br>


**Struggles:** 
I'm pausing on the tribute page because I'm struggling on ideas of who to pay tribute to!! Also, I'd need to figure out a way to get the src right.


<br>

**Thoughts:**

I'm not going for an hour of coding. I'm just coding a lil bit and keeping it pushing. I really need to start building out a JS project to solidify what I'm learning.

**Yesterday recap:**

RWD project - tribute page

<br>


**Today's plans:**

Apply to jobs
JS cert
RWD prject
Draft #100daysofcode update


<br>


**Struggles:** 
I started applying for jobs heavy on the 1st and I can feel my time management skills being tested. I'm setting my expectations for coding to be something like any lil bit I can do or learn, and I'll be happy.


<br>

**Thoughts:**

I need to do an update and rehash out what I'd like to get out of #100daysofcode. I think I want to define some projects to build out but we'll see haha


<br>
<br>
<br>

### Day 24: 4 Feb 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

- JS Cert
- Applying to jobs

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- JS cert
- Draft #100daysofcode update


<br>

**Thoughts:**

I'm on to regex now and I think I'm getting the hang of it, but the random charater flags is going to be tricky. I wonder if there's like a flashcard / game to help getting use to the syntax in a fun way.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Day 25: 5 Feb 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

- JS Cert

<br>


**Today's plans:**

<br>


**Struggles:**

I'm behind on my bootcamp. And I'm also worried at all the JS knowledge is disappering right before my eyes. 


<br>

**Thoughts:**

I'm a lil behind on my JS bootcamp. Just about a week and I haven't attempted any of the projects, but I'm thinking I'll work on it tomorrow. Today I haven't been in the best mood, I think writing a retrospective of my 25 days will be a nice break.
