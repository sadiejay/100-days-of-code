**Struggles:** 

JS is kicking my behind. The switch operator lesson in the cert made no sense. I had to check the hint and see others struggling and saying the same thing. So I felt a lil better. But I am shaken. 2 days in a row. I'm going to make a post about it.

**Struggles:** 

Time management is now a concern. I worked on the fCC JS course all day. I'm not feeling too well so I wasn't on top of my time management game.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

This is a roller coaster. I'm struggling with objects again lol I'm gonna give less time to the fCC course tomorrow and dive into my open source issue.exercism
