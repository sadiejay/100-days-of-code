<br>

**Struggles:** 

Trying not to overwhelm myself. I need to pace myself!!

<br>


**Struggles:** 

JS is kicking my behind. The switch operator lesson in the cert made no sense. I had to check the hint and see others struggling and saying the same thing. So I felt a lil better. But I am shaken. 2 days in a row. I'm going to make a post about it.

<br>


**Links:** 
- [Technical Documentation Page for fCC RWD Cert](https://codepen.io/sadiejay/pen/QWqoNoz) - got the skeleton done. Gonna laid down the CSS this week. Looking forward to using `overscroll-behavior`.

- Complete one RWD project for fCC
- Check out the #100daysofcode tag on dev.to
-Play around with my open source issue

<br>


**Struggles:** 

Time management is now a concern. I worked on the fCC JS course all day. I'm not feeling too well so I wasn't on top of my time management game.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

This is a roller coaster. I'm struggling with objects again lol I'm gonna give less time to the fCC course tomorrow and dive into my open source issue.exercism


**Links:** 
- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/) - Checked out this site for more js practice!

- Work on the JS Cert with fCC (but not all day!)
- Make progress on one RWD project for fCC
- Check out the #100daysofcode tag on dev.to

<br>


**Struggles:** 
My open source issue is down on gitlab and I'm not sure if I should say something? I think I'll check again tomorrow and if it's still not working I'll reach out. I'll work on a RWD project for now.


<br>

**Thoughts:**
I took it easy today. After yesterday I could use a break from going so hard in the code. I at least figured out what the issue was in the lesson I struggled with all day, and had help from the community. That felt good.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Day 8: 19 Jan 2022

- Completed fCC task that gave me trouble
- Tried to tinker on open source issue, but it was experiencing a bug

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- Comment on my open source issue
- Change og info portfolio site to show different fav icon/sm photo
- Figure out how to get commits into my contribution graph
- Draft up a couple of DEV.to articles
    - my favorite keyboard shortcuts
    - my hacktoberfest experience

<br>


**Struggles:** 
Understanding when to say "Hey something's wrong" on my open source issue. I didn't want to add fuel to the fire, but I also don't want to withhold info. 

<br>

**Thoughts:**
I'm realizing that my experience contributing to open source projects was really valuable. I'm gonna talk that up.

**Links:**

<br>
<br>

### Day 9: 20 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

- Commented on my open source issue
- Updated my portfolio

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- Test on my open source issue
- Figure out how to get commits into my contribution graph
- Work on JS cert


<br>


**Struggles:** 

Now I'm stuggling to manage timing a "hey I need some help," response haha. I'm trying to make a footer stick to the bottom of a page. My solution works when the height is signifigantly taller than the width. However, when the width is wider than the height (ex. mobile screens in landscape mode) the footer blocks content on the screen. I think, I'm almost positive there's a way to write a media query that'll style accordingly, but that's over my head at the moment. It's all part of the learning experience tho.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

I've made it to loops in my JS cert and I'm playing around with `push` / `unshift`. I can make an array list even and odd numbers backwards using a simple loop, with either method, and it makes me happy.

<br>


### Day 10: 21 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

- Test on my open source issue
- Figure out how to get commits into my contribution graph
- Work on JS cert

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- Talk to someone in my network about their role and job applying experience.



<br>


**Struggles:** 
I'm feeling a little bad that I'm not going to be able to do as much on the weekends but I'm also ok about that too. I need to manage how much time I do this and have a life.


<br>

**Thoughts:**
I was really happy to have had talked with a dev in my network. I'm really inspired to start the job hunt and I feel less presure to "know everything".
<br>
<br>
<br>


### Day 11: 22 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

- Reached out to dev in my network
- Work on JS cert

<br>


**Today's plans:**

Make one change and relax


<br>


**Struggles:** 
Not really struggling right now. I'm happy to have made my lil change and keep today about life outside of the computer


<br>

**Thoughts:**
Enjoy the weekend!
Hope the fork detaches soon!

### Day 12: 23 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

Updated description on portfolio

<br>


**Today's plans:**

Make one change and relax


<br>


**Struggles:** 



<br>

**Thoughts:**

<br>

**Links:** 
- [Technical Documentation Page for fCC RWD Cert](https://codepen.io/sadiejay/pen/QWqoNoz) - Added `id`s per test requirements. It was uncomfortable adding special characters in the names of the `id`s. I honestly thought you couldn't so I learned something there!
<br>
<br>
<br>


### Day 13: 24 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

Edited fCC project

<br>


**Today's plans:**
Make one change and relax


<br>


**Struggles:** 

Again it felt super weird to add special charaters to `href`s.


<br>

**Thoughts:**

Gonna get back into JS now that I've made some progress in my fCC project.

### Day 14: 25 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

Edited fCC project

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- Work on JS Cert
- Update resume


<br>


**Struggles:** 

I'm struggling to understand how to use the length of an array in a recursive function. The profile lookup task has me stumped.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

My pomodoro clock of choice now doesn't work. I'm struggling to find an app that'll work in the background and allow me to change up the focus/break state. I wanna do it with JS but also make my own app if I have to.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Day 15: 26 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

Work on JS Cert
Update resume

<br>


**Today's plans:**

Update my github readme


<br>


**Struggles:** 

Not much today. I think I need a lil bit of a challenge to make up for the slack of the past week-ish.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

I like doing the fCC JS activities, but I don't like that there's no interface or a way to save my code. I think I'm gonna try and build something around one of the tasks. Especially on that uses JSON data. I'm gonna take a look at [frontend mentor](frontendmentor.io) to see if I can get some design ideas/inspo.

### Day 16: 27 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**


Updated github profile readme

<br>


**Today's plans:**

Work on RWD Cert projects


<br>


**Struggles:** 

I don't want to lose steam on my RWD project, but I also don't want to get too into the weeds with styling. Especially when it's not required.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

I finished a RWD project!!! WHOO!! 1 down, 4 more to go. It's not my best design work (no design) and I need to clean up the code, but it's passing. I can breathe.

Work on RWD Cert projects

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- One change and relax
- JS Cert (maybe?)


<br>


**Struggles:** 



<br>

**Thoughts:**

I'm going ahead and starting the tribute page. I can always go back and add the styling to these projects.

### Day 19: 30 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**


- Work on RWD Cert projects

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- JS cert
- Code Assessment for job application
- Prep job materials


<br>


**Struggles:** 

Not being able to figure out the code assesment was a lil bit of a blow to my confidence.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

I'm still glad for the expereince. It was the best code assessment I've encountered. I can actually understand how data structures fit in the real world. I'm a lil more interested in learning how to extract info from JSON. The JS cert was a step in the right direction for that.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Day 20: 31 Jan 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

- Code Assessment for job application
- Prep job materials

<br>


**Today's plans:**

RWD project - tribute page


<br>


**Struggles:** 

Darn it. I missed pushing to github yesterday. And I did a ton of coding yesterday in fCC!!

<br>

**Thoughts:**

Next time I notice I didn't commit for the day, I'm just gonna stop and do something. Lesson learned.

**Yesterday recap:**

RWD project - tribute page

<br>


**Today's plans:**

RWD project - tribute page
JS cert


<br>


**Struggles:** 



<br>

**Thoughts:**

Just plugging along with JS and the tribute page. I don't like building without a design so this is a challenge for me. I"m going to mimic the fCC design and just leave it at that. I'm missing the [frontend mentor](frontendmentor.io) projects now. On the brightside.  Ithink with what I've learned in th JS course I can build out some of the logic to some basic game or calculator.

### Day 22: 2 Feb 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

RWD project - tribute page

<br>


**Today's plans:**


RWD project - product landing page



<br>


**Struggles:** 
I'm pausing on the tribute page because I'm struggling on ideas of who to pay tribute to!! Also, I'd need to figure out a way to get the src right.


<br>

**Thoughts:**

I'm not going for an hour of coding. I'm just coding a lil bit and keeping it pushing. I really need to start building out a JS project to solidify what I'm learning.

**Yesterday recap:**

RWD project - tribute page

<br>


**Today's plans:**

Apply to jobs
JS cert
RWD prject
Draft #100daysofcode update


<br>


**Struggles:** 
I started applying for jobs heavy on the 1st and I can feel my time management skills being tested. I'm setting my expectations for coding to be something like any lil bit I can do or learn, and I'll be happy.


<br>

**Thoughts:**

I need to do an update and rehash out what I'd like to get out of #100daysofcode. I think I want to define some projects to build out but we'll see haha


<br>
<br>
<br>

### Day 24: 4 Feb 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

- JS Cert
- Applying to jobs

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- JS cert
- Draft #100daysofcode update


<br>

**Thoughts:**

I'm on to regex now and I think I'm getting the hang of it, but the random charater flags is going to be tricky. I wonder if there's like a flashcard / game to help getting use to the syntax in a fun way.

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Day 25: 5 Feb 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

- JS Cert

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- JS cert
- Draft and publish #100daysofcode update


<br>


**Struggles:**

I'm behind on my bootcamp. And I'm also worried at all the JS knowledge is disappering right before my eyes. 


<br>

**Thoughts:**

I'm a lil behind on my JS bootcamp. Just about a week and I haven't attempted any of the projects, but I'm thinking I'll work on it tomorrow. Today I haven't been in the best mood, I think writing a retrospective of my 25 days will be a nice break.

<br>

<br>


**Struggles:**



<br>

**Thoughts:**

Not feeling the best today. I finished the regrex section of the JS cert and was thinking to start a project. But, I'm going to relax a bit and see how that goes for me.

### Day 28: 8 Feb 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

- RWD project

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- Applying to jobs
- JS cert


<br>


**Struggles:**

I've just been applying to jobs nonstop. I haven't coding as much as I wanted. Or really done anything other than job stuff.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

I thought of the idea of creating an email finder. I think a simple project would be to create a form that takes the first and last and company domain name. Then using regex create 3-5 possible emails from the input. Something like: 
- ```{first}.{last}@company``` 
- ```{f}{last}@company```
- ```{first}{last}@company```

Then the next step would be to figure out how to get the emails verified and return the one that's the highest most likely match.

<br>


**Struggles:**

Balancing health, rest, and completing this daily task

<br>

**Thoughts:**

I feel awful today. I haven't slept much at all today and had to cancel everything and keep a watch on me. It's evening and I'm feeling better than I was 12 hours ago, so I may just do one JS cert task and call it a day.

**Today's plans:**

- Email Generator
- JS cert


<br>


**Struggles:**

Balancing health, rest, and completing this daily task

<br>

**Thoughts:**

I'm feeling much better today thankfully. Still not sure if I'm out of the weeds just yet, but I'm hopeful.

I started my email generator project today. Thinking more about it I'm kinda like, "how am I going to do this?"

I'm writing each function out separtely, but I'm not sure how I'm going to get them to chain together.

**Yesterday recap:**

- Email Generator
- JS cert

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- Email Generator


<br>


**Struggles:**

Balancing health, rest, and completing this daily task

<br>

**Thoughts:**

I'm trying to write out a function that'll log each of the inputs. I think I know how I want to do that using `var.value` then either creating an array or just apply regex? I'm not sure, but I'll figure it out.

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- Email Generator


<br>


**Struggles:**

Balancing health, rest, and completing this daily task

<br>

**Thoughts:**

Well I'm amazed that I got the function to log the input and push to an array. I'm now wanting to create key value pairs, somehow. Naming the index, so instead of:
>    `0: firstNameValue`

it would look something like:
> `firstNameInput: firstNameValue`

I'm also wanting a more elegant solution for going through the inputs, like maybe using a do while or for each loop? Idk. But I think there's something I could other than list each input out.

**Struggles:**

Balancing health, rest, and completing this daily task

<br>

**Thoughts:**

Ok So! I've gotten a function to show `first@domain` but! It only works with the log. Whenever I comment out the log it doesn't show on the page :(

I think it has something to do with the `preventDefault` that I have on the submit click event, not allowing for the output message to show.

<br>


**Struggles:**

Trying to have a life and code and apply for jobs.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

I've fallen off with my JS cert tasks. I'm glad to be working on it again, becuse it's giving me some ideas for the email generator.

<br>


**Struggles:**

Trying to have a life and code and apply for jobs.

I'm getting a lil stuck on how to get the mulitple outputs to show up using `.innerText`? Maybe I'll create a p tags for each output? That sounds like something I could be able to do with JS.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

Figured out another function!! Using temperate literals is the way to go haha

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- Open Source Contribution (yay!)


<br>


**Struggles:**

I can't figure out how to make what was suggested to work. I'm trying to make a footer stick to the bottom and these are the changes I want to make:

```css
html,
body {
    height: 100%;
}
 /*container div*/
.__next{
  height: 100%;
  min-height: 100%;
  position: relative;
}
/*footer*/
.makeStyles-root-121{
    min-height: 300px;
    /*(min-height because it's dynamic not hard height defined) */
    position: absolute;
    /* toggling the posistion sometimes makes things better sometimes it does make a difference */
    bottom: 0;
}
```


It looks great until devices are in landscape mode with more content :(
<br>

**Thoughts:**

I'm glad to have gotten back in touch with the maintainers of my project. That's been on my head for a while.

### Day 42: 22 Feb 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

- JS Cert

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- Tackle Take Home Project
- Open Source Project (was down again)


<br>


**Struggles:**

Trying to come to terms that I'm struggling with this full-stack take home challenge. I couldn't understand what to google to even get me on the a track.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

I'm trying not to be discouraged and take it as a learning experience, but it's hard to disapoint others.

<br>
<br>

<br>


**Today's plans:**

- Tackle Take Home Project


<br>


**Struggles:**

Avoiding this take home project because it's overwheleming to me. I don't think I can do it and I'm struggling with even beginning when I know I'm going to fail.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

I need to try or either go to sleep.

### Day 45: 25 Feb 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

- Tackle Take Home Project


<br>


**Today's plans:**

- Coderbyte assessment


<br>


**Struggles:**

Still struggling with the fear of not being "good enough" 

<br>

**Thoughts:**

I had an assessment that wanted a function that had a rating system between 0 - 5 with .5 increments. For every 1 log full and for the half log "half" and if there were less than 5 items then log "empty." I only had an hour to figure it out. They didn't want an array which confused me, but I almost got it and was tinkering when time ran out. I was surprised that I would get as far as I did. But I didn't like not being able to leave and save my work to check out the other question. I never got to see it :(

Amazed that it's been 50 days. I need complete a project or two soon to feel accomplished. My email generator is coming along. I need to figure out why the functions themselves are logging and not the function with given parameters.

<br>


**Struggles:**

I can't figure out how to get slice to extract all but the first character of a string.

<br>

**Thoughts:**
I need to clean up the logic soon but so far it's ok. I kind of have a plan for how I want to combine all of the pieces in a huge function that'll take 3 parameters and then run through all of the combos.

### Day 54: 6 Mar 2022
**Yesterday recap:**

- JS Cert


<br>


**Today's plans:**

- Open Source Contribution


<br>


**Struggles:**

I can't figure out how to create a PR for this and Gitpod is a headache. I pushed some commits and now need to delete them somehow because my acutal email is being exposed.

```javascript
// in web/pages/_documents.tsx
<body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
          <style jsx global>{`
            /* Adds global styles to html, body and main id*/
            html,
            body {
              height: 100%;
            }
            #__next {
              height: 100%;
              min-height: 100%;
              position: relative;
            }
          `}</style>
        </body>

// in /web/componenets/Footer/Footer.tsx
const useStyles = makeStyles((theme) => ({
  root: {
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "column",
    width: "100%",
    minHeight: "300px",
    // (min-height because it's dynamic not hard height defined)
    position: "absolute",
    // toggling the posistion sometimes makes things better, sometimes it does not make a difference
    bottom: "0",
  },
```

<br>

**Thoughts:**
I need to pair program more often. I got this far with someone in my Virtual Coffee Community and I've learned so much about `.tsx` and `.jsx` in those couple of hours.

<br>


**Struggles:**

Trying to keep my confidence and momentum with growing my skills

<br>

**Thoughts:**
I just got 3 take home tests today. It's def a good problem to have, not only so I get to exercise my skills, I also get to be in the place and work through the mental blocks I have with these things. I'm not losing whatever happens. That's what I'm trying to tell myself.

**Today's plans:**

- Take home tests


<br>


**Struggles:**

Trying to keep my confidence and momentum with growing my skills

<br>

**Thoughts:**
I had to reassess the take home. I was supposed to use js to dynamically build the site. I didn't think I could do it but I didn't run into too many difficulities. I learned a good bit too like I knew off createElement but never got to build something with it, using my own hands. I didn't get to all of the design elements, but just being able to go outside of my comfort zone and surprise myself, was a very valuable experience.

<br>

**Thoughts:**

Had the round two interview going over the take home assignment. I think it went well? I was excited to be asked questions about the js aspect and while I can't say I felt confident, I at least could pick up on the questions after my memory had been jogged a bit. I need to speak more about js and get into that habit.

**Thoughts:**

I peeked at the Jekyll take home and yikes lol I'm in over my head. I wish I had the bandwidth to start earlier.

On the flip side, thanks to my other take home, I was able to incorporate some `createElement()` in my javascript for the email generator.
