Trying not to overwhelm myself. I need to pace myself!!

**Struggles:** 

JS is kicking my behind. The switch operator lesson in the cert made no sense. I had to check the hint and see others struggling and saying the same thing. So I felt a lil better. But I am shaken. 2 days in a row. I'm going to make a post about it.
